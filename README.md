Brick Breaker

Game is still a prototype.Updates to work on: 
- Level 1 and 2 have been made but are identical.
- Highscore function has not been created.
- Highscore database and form display needs to be added.
- Game score works but is not ideal, needs to be cleaned up.
- Collision detection works but needs to be tinkered with to be more accurate to what the players sees.
- 

I am remaking the game in Unity and will push this to GitHub after it is up and running.
